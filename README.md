# Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Objective:
This project involves loading, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset using Python. The goal is to perform basic data analysis with `pandas`, and create visualizations with `matplotlib` to uncover trends, distributions, and relationships in the data.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing data (replace `your_dataset.csv` with the actual dataset name). The analysis focuses on:
- Loading and exploring the dataset.
- Cleaning any missing values.
- Performing basic statistical analysis.
- Visualizing data using various types of plots.

## Libraries Used:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `seaborn`: For additional styling of visualizations (optional).

## Project Structure:
- **data_analysis.py**: Main Python script that loads, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes the data.
- **your_dataset.csv**: The CSV file containing the dataset (replace this with your actual dataset).
  
## Steps:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file.
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset to inspect the data.
   - Check for missing values and handle them by filling with mean values.
   - Check the data types of the columns.

2. **Basic Data Analysis**:
   - Compute basic statistics (mean, median, etc.) of the numerical columns.
   - Group the data by a categorical column and compute mean values for each group.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Line Chart**: Show trends over time (e.g., sales data).
   - **Bar Chart**: Compare average values across categories (e.g., average petal length per species).
   - **Histogram**: Visualize the distribution of a numerical column (e.g., sepal length).
   - **Scatter Plot**: Visualize the relationship between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length).

## Installation Instructions:
1. **Install Python**: Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Open the terminal and run the following command to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
